### Personal Docker Runtime Fix – KG's Note

While walking my beloved dogs 🐕 during a break, I successfully resolved the Docker container runtime issue and restarted OpenHands locally.

After multiple attempts, I was able to:
- Reconfigure Docker Desktop containers,
- Resolve port binding and container restart issues,
- Verify runtime status via VS Code + Docker extension,
- See the app finally running: "エージェントがユーザー入力を待機中..."

Here’s the tweet documenting the victory:

This note documents that OpenHands is robust enough to survive real-world misconfigurations and still recover—just like a resilient dev in the wild.
